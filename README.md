# Glow-2019 - Frightend flowers

## Concept

There was this biologist and he got bullied a lot when he was younger, the only way he found peace and comfort was by talking to his plants. The plants wouldn’t call him names or judge him.
 
But, after a while he got bored. He would share all his problems with the plants, but the plants couldn’t share theirs. He started to do experiments with the plants, with an effort to get to know the plants better.
 
After a while, he found a way to make the plants communicate with each other through light. The biologist now made visual what was going on with the plants; not only for the plants themselves but also for the eyes of the people.
 
While the biologist observed the communications, something strange happened. When the biologist was a few meters away, the plants would very calmly and rarely communicate with each other. But, when the biologist came close, the plants would go wild.
 
The biologist did not understand why and tried to figure it out. He put the plants on the floor close to his desk, and observe tirelessly until he knew what was going on.
 
After a while, he would notice something strange. When he was extremely close to a plant for a while, he noticed that that plants would suddenly stop communicating. It would take a while when they started again, and in the meantime, they wouldn’t grow. And then he knew.
 
The plants were terrified of him. Because they were afraid, they let each other know a human was near. 

The biologist was very shocked by this. So much that he decided he had to let the entire world know what was going on. This led to the creation of Frightened Flowers
